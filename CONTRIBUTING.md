So you are ready to battle with code? Good.

## Technologies ##
After a long debate we decided to not use plain Javascript.
Why? Because trying to expand the codebase is pretty difficult after a while.
Instead we decided to use [Dart](http://dartlang.org).
If you look at the code you will see that the syntax is very similar to languages such as Java or C.

The default installation procedure is kinda weird,
so we made a wiki page [Dart Installation](https://github.com/redbrick/website-frontend/wiki/Dart-Installation)

## Installation ##
Make sure you have Dart installed

1. Clone the git repo
2. In the repo root run `pub get`. This will install all the necessary dependencies
3. To quickly test everything run `pub serve`. This will create a HTTP server running on port `8080`. Run `pub help` to get information on how to change the port
